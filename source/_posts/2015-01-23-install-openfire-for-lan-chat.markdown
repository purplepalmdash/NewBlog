In order to support chat in LAN, install Openfire, following are the steps for installing and configurating.    

### Local Machine

```
$ wget 
$ apt-get update &&  apt-get install default-jre

```
Since another people is also installing this. Change it to DigitalOcean.   

### Dockerize Openfire
Get the image via:    

```
docker pull sameersbn/openfire

```
Since the installation is already done, docker ignored...
