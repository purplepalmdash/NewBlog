This worktips will enable the visibility for ansible deployed nodes.      

```
[root@z_WHServer Code]# cd ansible-tower-setup-2.1.5/
[root@z_WHServer ansible-tower-setup-2.1.5]# ls
ansible.cfg  configure  group_vars  host_vars  README.md  roles  setup.sh  site.yml
```

Later I will finish this. But remember the tutorial pdf works well.
