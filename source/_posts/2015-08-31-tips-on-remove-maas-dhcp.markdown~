### Solution
Previous I always encounter problems in removing maas-dhcp, so I checked some materials
show the result is because I disabled apparmor, the solution is:    

```
$ vim /etc/default/grub
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="security=selinux selinux=1  apparmor=1 security=apparmor"
```
Add apparmor related, and reboot the computer.    
Now you could remove the maas-dhcp and install new softwares.   

### TIPS
View apparmor status:    

```
sudo apparmor_status
```
Via restart you could know the exact reason:   

```
$ sudo /etc/init.d/apparmor restart
* Reloading AppArmor profiles * AppArmor not available as kernel LSM.
[fail]
```
The reason is because the LSM is not avaiable, by editing the grub configuration you
could enable apparmor again.
